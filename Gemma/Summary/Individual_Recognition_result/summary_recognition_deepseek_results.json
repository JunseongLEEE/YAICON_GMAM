This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\n\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\"\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\n\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\" he explains.\n\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\n\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\n\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\n\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\n\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\"\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\n\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\" says Cotter. \"It was about creating clarity.\n\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\n\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\n\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\" Cotter recalls.\n\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\n\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\"\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\n\"We know that these teams are very good,\" he insists. \"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\"\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\nHe would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\n\"I'm not going to lie, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster,\" Cotter admits. \"I've had some great times and some tough times. I've had some great people around me.\n\"I've had some great players. I've had some great coaches. I've had some great staff. I've had some great",

This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nThe biggest Commons clash is likely to be over Sunday trading  - where a well organised group of Tory rebels looks set to line up with Labour, to try to strike down proposals to loosen restrictions. The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.\nElsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords \"ping-pong\" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.\nThen it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the \"Work Related Activities Group\", and content themselves with a \"regret\" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another \"regret motion\" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.\nAnd that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.\nHe says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\nAfter that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.\nAnd there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.\nThere will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.\nIn Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.\nAnd at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a Â£1bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a Â£20bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, and then a debate on the future of the UK's nuclear deterrent, led by the SNP's Angus MacNeil.\nThen MPs turn to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals",

This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nStudents earlier this summer took a total of 35,537 exams.\nBut what do we know about how well Wales is doing? How many students are going to university? And what happens next for those still with big decisions to make?\nMAKING THE GRADE\nA new top grade, A*, was introduced in 2010. A total of 6.6% achieved this in 2016, a fall on last year and still short of the UK average of 8.1%.\nThe proportion of students getting A* and A also fell again from 23.1% to 22.7% and Wales continues to trail the rest of the UK and all regions of England apart from the North East of England.\nWhen you look at individual subjects, more students in Wales have been getting top grades in maths over the last five years than in England - but in English language, Wales has been trailing, with the gap still 3.2% in the latest set of results.\nIn French, 31% got A* to A in Wales - this is an improvement, but 37.8% managed that in England. The gap was as wide as 14% in 2012. Numbers of students taking French have also gone down by 11% this year.\nWales and England are a little further apart now at the top grades for A-level physics, with Wales dropping back to 25.8% behind England on 29.6%.\nIt is worth looking too at how many students are only getting the lower grades.\nA slightly higher proportion in Wales - 23.5% - got D and E grades, compared to 20.6% in England. That gap has also widened slightly too.\nWales has more students getting these lower grades in English (23.2%) than who managed A* to A (15.9%) in the same subject.\nThere is also a more students getting D and E grades in French in Wales than in England for most of the last six years.\nDavid Evans, secretary of NUT Wales, said A-levels were the first time students specialised in subjects and it was important the quality of education and teaching was there.\n\"We need to look at the numbers who get  A* and celebrate them, and those who get As, Bs and Cs too,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure we have a clear focus on those who achieve the grades they need for university and makes sure support is there for those who go on to do other things as well.\"\nOn the question of whether A-levels are getting easier, Phil McTague, head teacher of Ysgol Eirias in Colwyn Bay said: \"If Usain Bolt sets a new record in the hundred metres, people don't say the hundred metres is getting easier!  Our students have worked really hard this year and we're proud of all their results.\"\nHOW DOES WALES COMPARE WITH ENGLISH REGIONS?\nFor the first time last year, we were able to compare Wales' results with regions of England on the day they were published.\nWales has the lowest percentage of A*-C grades of any area - 73.8- including every English region.\nIt also has the lowest for A* and A - apart from the North East of England, which is now lower than Wales.\nWHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS?\nGirls continue to outperform boys overall in Wales, with 97.9% of entries by girls this year gaining A* to E grades, compared to 96.5% of boys.\nAt the A* grade, the performance of boys was marginally better than that of girls, with 6.7% of boys and 6.5% of girls gaining A* - both improving since 2013.\nYou can also see performance differences between boys and girls for the top grades within subjects - as well as a difference in subjects chosen. The likes of physics and computing are very male dominated compared to French, English and Welsh at the other end of the scale.\nGareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC exam board, said some of the patterns were long standing \"and a natural feature\".\nWhy do more girls go to university?\nHOW MANY STUDENTS APPLY FROM WALES?\nThere were 23,740 students from Wales applying to universities in the UK this year - and with many looking at more than one university, this meant a total of 40,010 applications to Ucas.\nThere is very little difference in the number of students from Wales applying to university over the last few years.\nMore than half a million students got higher education places in the UK last year - three quarters of those who applied. These included 20,500 students from Wales, a 1.7% rise and a new high, while 87.5% of 18-year-olds from Wales who applied got places.\nOf those 18-year-old students who applied to Welsh universities, 84% got an offer, while 75% of Welsh applicants to English universities got an offer.\nAlthough there is a lot of attention at schools on results day - only around half of those entering university are 18-year-olds; others take gap years while the number of students over 26 is rising again.\nBy the end of Thursday, Ucas said 17,510 students from Wales had places in higher education - more than at the same time over the last five years.\nSTILL, MORE 18-YEAR-OLDS ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY\nWales recorded its highest entry rate - 28.2% of all 18-year-olds got higher education places through Ucas in 2015 - although that is behind England on 31.3%.\nWales has had one of the lowest proportional increases of UK nations and regions since 2006 - 13%.\nWHERE YOU LIVE CAN BE A FACTOR\nFewer pupils from poorer parts of Wales get to university.\nEntry rates are broken down across the UK into constituencies and analysis shows they are lower in more disadvantaged areas.\nIn Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North.\nFor those in the most disadvantaged districts in Wales the average rate is 16.6%, almost the same as the year before.\nBut compared with entry rates five years ago, 18-year-olds from disadvantaged areas in Wales were 23% more likely to be accepted for entry in 2015 - in England they were 30% more likely.\nMeanwhile, students living in what are classed as the most advantaged areas of Wales are five-and-a-half times more likely to go to a university with higher entry requirements than those from the most disadvantaged parts.\nLeading academic Prof Sir Deian Hopkin said the numbers from poorer backgrounds getting to university were still disappointing despite efforts.\n\"One of the great challenges in higher education is to attract students from less-affluent backgrounds because. very often, they come from an education system which doesn't encourage them to come to university in the first place,\" he said.\n\"Now a lot has been done over the years, there has been a big improvement, but the proportion has not grown at the same rate as the total increase in students in higher education. Therefore the challenge remains.\"\nProf Hopkin added: \"The disappointment in England is that the grant which supported many students has been abolished.\n\"In Wales, at least that has been maintained for now, but we need to see far more effort being put into encouraging, supporting and, indeed, mentoring students from backgrounds where these things are not natural.\"\nWHERE DO STUDENTS AT WELSH UNIVERSITIES COME FROM?\nAltogether, 77,750 students have already applied to Welsh universities - 18,450 from within Wales.\nThe chart shows where the others come from - more than half of them from England.\nUNCONDITIONAL OFFERS ON THE RISE\nThere has been a rise in students receiving unconditional offers from universities - which will have relieved the exam pressure a little for some. Across the UK, offers were made to 23,400 students in 2015,  compared to only 3,000 two years before.\nThis is around 2.5% of applications and involves 36 institutions, but there is no breakdown of how many are from Wales.\nCardiff and Swansea universities only made unconditional offers to students who are pre-qualified. This amounted to 1,200 for Cardiff this year.\nAberystwyth University said it made offers based on performance in its own scholarship exam, while Bangor University said it made unconditional offers to some of the most promising students, but they were looking \"at the whole package\" before deciding where to go.\nCLEARING: NO LONGER A LAST RESORT\nAround 4,100 students from Wales were looking for places on results day through the clearing system, which is designed to help students who have not got a place at university.\nThis is a 10% increase on the previous year, but the number of places available through clearing has also risen.\nThe clearing system has changed over the years, with more universities offering places through it and it is no longer seen as a last resort.\nIt is also worth noting that the number of students from Wales",

It's difficult to get into, and for many people, it's difficult to know where it's going.\nAt Kiev International Airport, I hand my passport to a border guard.\n\"Purpose of visit?\" he asks.\n\"Journalism. I'm with the BBC.\"\nHe pauses. He studies my passport. He seems to be checking a list. He goes to pick up a telephone and asks a question. He does not realise I can hear.\n\"You remember that pro-Russian journalist from the BBC? Was his surname Rosenberg?\"\nAnother pause.\n\"It wasn't? OK, thanks.\" He hangs up. He stamps my passport and returns it.\n\"Welcome to Ukraine!\" he smiles.\nThose pauses at passport control are an indication of the current tension between Moscow and Kiev - a relationship clouded by enmity and suspicion.\nOur BBC team is only passing through Kiev. Our final destination is Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia three years ago.\nFor journalists based in Russia, there are faster ways of reaching the Crimean peninsula. Board a plane in Moscow and two hours later you can be in the Crimean capital Simferopol. Ukraine, however, warns foreign nationals that anyone entering \"temporarily occupied Crimea\" without Kiev's permission and without crossing an official Ukrainian border may be banned from future entry to Ukraine.\nWe're taking the longer route.\nDirect flights from Russia to Ukraine stopped in October 2015. We flew from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, then on to Kiev. Ahead of us is an eight-hour road trip to Crimea.\nFirst, we visit the Ukrainian Migration Service in Kiev to obtain the \"dozvil\" - a document issued by the Ukrainian authorities permitting travel to Crimea. Three hours later, permission slips in hand, our long car journey south begins.\nRussia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a watershed moment. It pushed Moscow and the West to the brink of a new cold war. Three years on we are travelling to Crimea to gauge the mood.\nIt is dark by the time we reach the final Ukrainian checkpoint before the peninsula. Ukraine does not call the Kalanchak crossing a border - officially, it is a \"control point for entry and exit\". We show our passports and dozvils. Minutes later we are waved through.\nThe no-man's land between the Ukrainian and Russian checkpoints is tiny - no more than 50m long. We stop here to change cars - our Kiev driver will turn back.  A driver from Simferopol has come to meet us.\nOn the Russian side this is called the Armyansk crossing. As far as the Russians are concerned, it is an official state border. We show passports and visas and fill out immigration cards. Our documents are in order, but we are asked to wait. The appearance here of British journalists has raised official eyebrows.\nA young man in civilian clothes approaches me. \"Come with me, please,\" he says, \"I'd like to have a chat.\"\nWe enter a small room and sit down at a table. He checks my phone to make sure I am not recording our conversation.\nThen come the questions. Lots of them.\n\"What mission have your editors set you? What will you be filming? How will you be saving your material, on computers or hard drives? What SIM card will you be using in Crimea? As the correspondent, will you be making notes each night about what you have filmed? Can you show me some of the photos on your phone? Where will you be staying? Why didn't you fly direct from Moscow?\"\nMy interrogator notes down my answers on a piece of paper. His questions are not limited to Crimea.\n\"What street do you live on in Moscow? What is the nearest Metro station to your home? What does your wife do for a living? You've been in Russia a long time. Have you ever considered applying for a Russian passport?\"\n\"My British one suits me just fine,\" I reply.\n\"What do you think of English cuisine?\" he asks, adding, \"I like Jamie Oliver. Although I consider he uses too much oil.\"\nThe questioning lasts an hour. Then the official escorts me back to the van. I ask for his name.\n\"I have no name,\" he replies, \"only a rank.\"\nThe inquisitive young man with \"no name, only a rank\" invites my colleagues for similar conversations.\nThree hours pass. Interrogations over, we are still not free to go. We spend the night in the van waiting for Russian customs officers to process our papers and allow our TV equipment through. Ten hours after arriving at the Armyansk crossing, we finally clear the checkpoint.\nSimferopol is the administrative centre of Crimea. The name of our hotel is the \"Ukraine\". But three years after annexation, the town feels Russian. Most of the cars have switched to Russian number plates, brand new buses manufactured near Moscow have taken to the roads. And, peering down from billboards is the Russian president with some of his choicest Crimea quotations - just to remind everyone who is in charge.\n\"Crimea was famous for being the spa of the Soviet Union,\" declares Vladimir Putin in one poster. \"We will, of course, develop this.\"\n\"All Russian army social programmes will be extended to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet,\" he promises in another.\nNear our hotel, the wall of a building is covered with a giant painting of President Putin dressed as a sailor and the words: \"Crimea belongs to all of us\".\nAs far as retired teacher Olga Koziko is concerned, the more Putin in Crimea, the better.\n\"Crimea is a place where people support Putin,\" Olga assures me. \"We just adore him. He's our hero. I even have a T-shirt with Putin and the words: 'In Putin We Trust', like 'In God We Trust.' Thanks to Putin, Russian soldiers came to protect us.\"\nOn 22 February 2014, Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after what he - and his Russian allies - called an \"illegal coup\" in Kiev. On 27 February masked men in unmarked uniforms appeared in Simferopol. Armed with Russian weapons, they seized government buildings, the parliament, the airport and blocked Ukrainian army bases. This mysterious military force picked up a variety of nicknames, including The Little Green Men and The Polite People.\nToday Moscow admits the soldiers were from Russia's secretive Special Operations Forces (the SSO). President Putin subsequently signed a decree making 27 February an annual celebration in Russia - \"Special Operations Forces Day\".\nFollowing a hastily organised referendum, it was announced that more than 95% of people who had taken part had voted for Crimea's \"reunification\" with Russia. The referendum was not recognised by the international community. To the outside world, Russia had grabbed a piece of Ukraine.\nA statue honouring The Little Green Men has been erected near the Crimean parliament building. It depicts a young girl handing flowers to a man with a gun. The inscription reads: \"To The Polite People from the grateful people of Crimea.\"\nThis is how Moscow wants to be seen here: as a force for good, protecting the people of Crimea from violent Ukrainian nationalists. In 2014 Russia's state-controlled media characterised the new Ukrainian government as \"fascists\", \"neo-Nazis\" and an \"illegitimate junta''. Olga uses similar language as she recalls the past.\n\"Without Russia, a lot of people would have been killed here,\" maintains Olga. \"Ukrainian Nazis said Crimea would either be part of Ukraine or empty. People would have been oppressed. Perhaps even put in concentration camps.\"\nThere is absolutely no evidence to substantiate Olga's claims.\nMany of those in Crimea who welcome Moscow's rule see the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine as confirmation that Russia is a safer home. They discount evidence that unrest in the Donbass was incited and bankrolled by Moscow.\nOut on the street I get chatting to a pensioner called Nadezhda. Until recently her sister had been living in Luhansk, one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.\n\"Life in Luhansk is terrible,\" Nadezhda says. \"So I moved my sister to Crimea. I will do everything to make sure that kind of violence doesn't break out here.\"\nThere is another reason why Nadezhda, an ethnic Ukrainian, trusts Moscow more than Kiev - it is out of nostalgia for Soviet times, when she regarded Moscow as her capital. Nadezhda describes Crimea joining Russia as \"a return to the Soviet Union.  Our generation was, is and will always be in the USSR. We will die in the Soviet Union.\"\nNostalgia and fear are powerful feelings. But they are not enough to sustain pro-Russia sentiment in Crimea at the level of 2014.\nSevering ties to Ukraine has brought problems. With economic links to Ukraine cut, the only way of keeping the peninsula supplied is by sea or air. That means higher prices for food and other goods.\n\"The cost of living has increased,\" says a woman in a Simferopol supermarket. \"It's more expensive now. We used to buy everything from Ukraine. Now we have to buy everything from Russia.\"\nThe annexation of Crimea has also had a knock-on effect on the wider region. The Ukrainian government has cut off water supplies to Crimea,",

They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.\n\"It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.\"\nVeronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were \"Labour through and through\".\nThey backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.\n\"I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,\" she said.\n\"I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.\n\"It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.\"\nMr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls.\n\"The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.\n\"They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.\"\nFor a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.\nLabour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.\nBut although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.\nSo why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?\n\"Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,\" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.\n\"Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.\n\"When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.\"\nFrom the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.\nBut the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.\nData shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.\nIn recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.\nHanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than Â£1m in its thriving ceramics factory.\nMiddleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.\nMillions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.\nFor many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.\n\"The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,\" says Prof Temple.\n\"There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.\"\nFrom 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.\nBy 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.\nPub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.\n\"It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.\n\"I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.\n\"But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.\"\nTom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was \"very upset\" at the result.\n\"I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.\n\"There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.\n\"I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.\"\nUKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.\n\"They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,\" says Prof Temple.\nBetween the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.\n\"I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.\n\"Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.\n\"The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.\"\nNow Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.\nLee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.\n\"I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,\" he said.\n\"I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.\n\"I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.\"\nMr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.\n\"Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.\n\"I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.\n\"Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.\n\"On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.\n\"I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.\n\"It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.\"\nAnd Prof Temple agrees. \"It's a much more attractive place,\" he said.\n\"I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.\n\"Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.\n\"There's a very strong sense of community and people are very proud of their city.\"<|endoftext|>The 2018 World Cup is set to be the most expensive in history, with the total cost of the tournament expected to reach $14bn (£11.2bn).

This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nThe IPCC - weren't they the ones who said the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035? How can we trust what they say this time?\nThe weight given to the reports of the IPCC is a measure of the global scale of scientific involvement with the panel.\nDivided into three working groups that look at the physical science, the impacts and options to limit climate change, the panel involves thousands of scientists around the world.\nThe first report, to be presented in Stockholm, has 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries.\nThe 30-page Summary for Policymakers that will be published after review by government officials in the Swedish capital is based on around 9,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers and 50,000 comments from the expert reviewers.\nBut among these icebergs of data, things can and do go awry.\nIn the last report, published in 2007, there were a handful of well publicised errors, including the claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The wrong percentage was also given for the amount of land in the Netherlands under sea level.\nThe IPCC admitted it had got it wrong and explained that, in a report running to 3,000 pages, there were bound to be some mistakes. The Himalayan claim came from the inclusion of an interview that had been published in the magazine New Scientist.\nIn its own words, the IPCC is there \"to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts\".\nThe offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate.\nThese are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments.\nThe IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis.\nIn 2009, a review of the way the IPCC assesses information suggested the panel should be very clear in future about the sources of the information it uses.\nThe panel was also scarred by association with the \"Climategate\" rumpus. Leaked emails between scientists working for the IPCC were stolen and published in 2009.\nThey purported to show some collusion between researchers to make climate data fit the theory of human-induced global warming more clearly. However at least three investigations found no evidence to support this conclusion.\nBut the overall effect of these events on the panel has been to make them more cautious.\nAlthough this new report is likely to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, in terms of the scale, level and impacts, the word \"uncertainty\" features heavily.\n\"What we are seeing now is that this working group is getting more careful than they already were,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\"Overall, the message is, in that sense, more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones.\"\nHasn't global warming stopped since 1998?\nThe 2007 IPCC report made no mention of any slowdown or standstill in temperature rises in recent decades. They pointed out that the linear warming trend over the previous 50 years was 0.13C per decade, which was twice that for the past 100 years.\nThey forecast that, if emissions of carbon dioxide continued on their existing path, over the next century the climate would respond by warming between 2C and 4.5C, with a most likely rise of 3C.\nBut since 2007, climate sceptics have loudly argued that global average temperatures haven't actually gone above the level recorded in 1998.\nThe issue is now being taken more seriously by the IPCC and other respected science organisations.\nMy colleague David Shukman summarised some of the explanations now being offered as to why the temperatures have not risen more quickly in line with the modelling.\nMost scientists believe that the warming has continued over the past 15 years, but more of the heat has gone into the oceans. They are unsure about the mechanisms driving this change in behaviour.\nThe most recent peer reviewed article suggested that a periodic, natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean was counteracting the impact of carbon dioxide.\n\"1998 was a particular hot year due to a record-breaking El Niño event, while recently we have had mostly the opposite - cool conditions in the tropical Pacific,\" Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told BBC News.\n\"That warming has not stopped can be seen from the ongoing heat accumulation in the global oceans.\"\nClimate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide.\n\"In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,\" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process.\n\"These studies show that our real climate has a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2.0C. But the models are much more sensitive, and warm up three degrees.\"\nAm I going to get flooded?\nThe 2007 IPCC report was heavily criticised for its estimations on sea level rise.\nThe panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. Heat causes the seas to expand but also increases the rate of melting of glaciers and ice sheets.\nThe IPCC doesn't commission any new science, but reviews and condenses existing peer reviewed material.\nEach Summary for Policymakers is a short distillation of an underlying report that can stretch to several hundred pages. The final draft of the short summary is presented to representatives of the 195 governments who commission the report.\nIn a hectic week before publication, every single line is gone through by the scientists and civil servants. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report.\nThe IPCC figure didn't include any estimates for the extra water coming from the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets as they said they didn't have enough accurate information.\nOther researchers were critical of this approach and have published studies that suggested a far higher sea level rise.\nBut in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report.\n\"What we are talking about is a reduction in uncertainty - we find we haven't changed the number enormously compared to AR4 (IPCC 2007 report),\" said Prof David Vaughan, from the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), while speaking at the launch of the report.\n\"We've added maybe another 10cm but the level of certainty we have around that is actually higher than it was in the AR4.\"\nLeaked details from the forthcoming report indicate that the worst sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100, under the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, could reach 97cm.\nSome scientists, including Prof Rahmstorf, have been unhappy with the models used by the IPCC to calculate the rise. Using what's termed a semi-empirical model, the projections for sea level can reach 2m. At that point, an extra 187 million people across the world would be flooded.\nBut the IPCC is likely to say that there is no consensus about the semi-empirical approach and will stick with the lower figure of just under 1m.\nSo will all this mean more flooding?\n\"Yes, but not everywhere,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. \"Generally, the wet regions will get wetter and the dry ones drier.\"\nThe report is also likely to assess the intensity of storms, and there might be some better news in that there is likely to be a downwards revision.\nAnd what about the Polar bears?\nThe state of the North and South Poles has been of growing concern to science as the effects of global warming are said to be more intense in these regions.\nThe IPCC has evolved a complicated way of communicating scientific certainty and confidence in a finding:\nvery unlikely - 0-10%\nunlikely - 10-33%\nlikely as not - 33-66%\nlikely - 66-100%\nvery likely - 90-100%\nExtremely likely - 95-100%\nVirtually certain - 99-100%\nConfidence is also expressed as very low, low, medium, high and very high.\nEvidence can can be limited, medium or robust.\nAnd levels of agreement can be low, medium or high.\nThe 2007 IPCC report said that the loss of sea ice in the Arctic was very likely to continue, and that the loss of summer sea ice was very likely to be a permanent feature of the Arctic.\nThe 2007 report also said that the loss of sea ice in the Arctic was very likely to continue, and that the loss of summer sea",

More than 2,000 Jordanian citizens are believed to have travelled to Syria to fight in the past three years.\nBefore launching the air strikes on IS, the Jordanian military had doubled its military presence along the border with Iraq.\nThe killing of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh, captured by IS in December 2014, appears to have strengthened the government's resolve to take on the militants, with King Abdullah II saying his death would not be in vain and promising a \"severe response\".\nRegional Shia power Iran has seen IS - which regards Shia Muslims as heretics who should be killed - advance to within 25 miles (40km) of its border.\nAlthough Iran stands on the opposite side of much of the international community over Syria, it has called for co-operation against IS. It has reached out to its rival Saudi Arabia - the leading Sunni power - and turned a blind eye to US actions in Iraq, which it has historically opposed.\nOfficially Iran denies it has deployed any combat troops in Syria, but in June 2015, the official Irna news agency said at least 400 Iranian and Iran-based Afghan \"volunteers\" had been killed in the past four years.\nIn Iraq, the Iranians have played a key role in countering IS. Revolutionary Guards have advised Iraqi security forces, Iranian pilots have carried out air strikes, and Iranian-backed Shia militia have been mobilised.\nIran's growing role in Syria's war\nThe former Shia-dominated government of Nouri Maliki marginalised Iraq's Sunni community, creating conditions which helped the extremist Sunni IS come to prominence.\nWhen IS overran the northern city of Mosul in June 2014 before moving southwards, Mr Maliki requested US air strikes. However, US President Barack Obama said further military assistance was dependent on an inclusive government being formed.\nHe nevertheless launched air strikes in August 2014 when thousands of members of the Yazidi religious minority became trapped on Mount Sinjar.\nIn September 2014, Mr Maliki stepped aside and a new Iraqi government was named. The next phase of US assistance will reportedly involve an intensified effort to train, advise and equip the Iraqi military, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Sunni tribesmen willing to turn against IS.\nIt is not clear how new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi will deal with the Shia militiamen who have stopped IS reaching Baghdad. Some have been accused of operating outside of the state's control and carrying out reprisal attacks against Sunnis.\nSince the start of the uprising against his rule in March 2011, President Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly warned of the threat of Islamist extremists to Syria and the wider region.\nWestern powers initially dismissed Mr Assad's portrayal of his opponents as \"terrorists\", but became increasingly concerned by the rise of IS and al-Qaeda's affiliate, al-Nusra Front.\nAlthough they now acknowledge that IS cannot be beaten without attacking its strongholds in Syria, Western powers still want Mr Assad out of power and are reluctant to co-operate with him.\nThe Syrian foreign ministry said it was given advance warning of the US-led air strikes on IS targets on its territory in September 2014, stating it supported international efforts at \"combating terrorism\".\nRussia is not part of the US-led coalition but started carrying out air strikes in Syria in September 2015. It has also launched missiles from warships in the Caspian Sea.\nPresident Vladimir Putin says his country is targeting IS strongholds and other militant fighters. However, the US fears Russia is actually targeting opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is a Russian ally.\nRussia now believes that a bomb brought down the Russian airliner over Egypt last month, killing more than 200 people, mostly Russian holidaymakers. Sinai Province, an IS-linked Egyptian group, said it had downed the jet.\nRussia 'pounding IS' in Syria\nThe UAE was reported to have offered its air force to attack IS positions in Iraq before it participated in the military action in Syria in September 2014.\nIt is vehemently opposed to Islamist groups in the region and is believed to have launched air strikes on Islamist-allied militia in Libya from bases in Egypt in August 2014.\nHowever, US officials have told the BBC that the UAE suspended its involvement in the strikes after the Jordanian pilot was captured.\nQatar was another Gulf state to participate in or support the US-led military action against IS in Syria. The emirate is the location of Al Udeid Air Base, a highly-classified US facility from which all attack and surveillance missions in the region are co-ordinated by US Central Command (CentCom).\nThe Qatari government has been forced to repeatedly deny accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. However, wealthy individuals in the emirate are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria.\nDoha is also believed to have links to the al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate.\nBahrain has also participated in or supported the US-led military action against IS in Syria.\nThe kingdom hosts the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet, which is responsible for naval forces in the Gulf, Red Sea, Arabian Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean.\nTurkey is eager to defeat IS, which has advanced into territory along its borders with Syria and Iraq.\nTurkey believes that the deadly bombings in the border town of Suruc, in July 2015, which killed 32 youth activists, and in the capital Ankara in October, which killed nearly 100, were carried out by IS.\nTurkish jets have carried out attacks on IS positions in Syria, and the Nato member is allowing US jets to use its southern Incirlik air base.\nTurkey v Islamic State v the Kurds\nLebanon has become deeply divided by the conflict in Syria, and has had to deal with an overspill of violence and a huge influx of refugees.\nThe Lebanese government has been accused of providing safe haven to IS fighters, but has denied the claims.\nIsrael has not officially joined the US-led coalition against IS, but has reportedly carried out air strikes on the group in Syria.\nThe Israeli government has not confirmed these reports, but has said it will not tolerate the establishment of a \"terror state\" on its northern border",

This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nIn the wake of what is officially classified as one of the two worst nuclear accidents in history, ranking at Category Seven on the International Event Scale (INES), the \"electricity too cheap to meter\" vision of the 1950s appeared to be turning into a technology too costly to contemplate in terms of the human and financial balance-sheets.\nWithin weeks, Germany announced it would close all its nuclear reactors, and Switzerland followed suit. Even China, busiest of the new builders, delayed approval for new power stations.\nAnd around the world, opinion poll after opinion poll showed nuclear power losing its lustre.\n\"Fukushima impacted significantly, firstly on public opinion, and secondly by creating the need to analyse what happened from a technical point of view, to learn lessons and apply them,\" says Luis Echavarri, director-general of the ONuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\"I see a clear impact on plans for the future in the sense that there is a certain delay in taking decisions on new power plants - I think that's going to last for three to four years.\"\nThe vast majority of the reactors operating before Fukushima are still operating; even Germany stopped short of shutting them all down.\nThe glaring exception is in Japan itself, where only two out of 54 reactors are currently in operation. Some are shut for good; with others, local authorities have yet to decide whether to permit a restart.\nBut outside Japan, how does the future look a year on? Will Fukushima mark a full stop or just a comma in the nuclear story?\nAs always with this issue, the same set of facts produces very different interpretations.\nJohn Ritch, director-general of the industry-backed World Nuclear Association (WNA), believes it has created a small pause - nothing more.\n\"Fukushima was a setback in terms of public perception and increased timidity on the part of policymakers,\" he says.\n\"But we're quite confident that the underlying facts remain the same; and that's what's caused dozens of governments to review their policies for the 21st Century and decide to make nuclear energy a central part.\"\nCentral to those \"underlying facts\" is the need for rapid decarbonisation of global energy to avert dangerous climate change.\nGermany, he asserts, will come to rue its decision to pursue that goal through renewables alone.\nTom Burke, founding director of the sustainable development thinktank E3G and a long-time opponent of the nuclear industry, has a very different take.\n\"What I think will be even more significant [than German-style closures] in the long term is the economic impact,\" he says.\n\"The economics of nuclear have always been bad; and because countries such as Japan and Germany in particular are going to drive even harder into renewables, costs are going to come down even faster than they have, making nuclear even less cost-effective.\"\nHe also cites blockages in the supply chain, skills shortages and escalating concerns over Iran's possible military intentions as factors set to take nuclear out of the equation.\nOne thing is clear: even before Fukushima, the real centre of nuclear power was shifting from its traditional heavy users such as France and the US to Asia.\nTimeline: nuclear accidents\nSouth Korea has emerged as a major user of nuclear electricity and an exporter of technology; but China is the really big player.\nOf about 60 reactors under construction around the world, 26 are in China, with many more set to follow.\nThere are observers who quietly applaud China for its apparent capacity to build reactors on time and on budget, while European projects at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland flounder in a miasma of escalating costs and stretched deadlines.\nTom Burke is not among them. He points to the low building standards that contributed to the heavy death toll from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the recent health scare over melamine in milk products as evidence that China struggles with quality control - a key issue in building reliable nuclear reactors.\n\"How China is possibly going to create quality control mechanisms of a standard that exceed the Finns or the French is beyond me,\" he says.\n\"So what you're basically doing if you're in a country such as the UK is you're putting your future carbon policy in the hands of Chinese quality control inspectors, because if China drops another Category Seven incident, nobody's going to be able to run reactors.\"\nThe UK and many other countries are - at least on paper - pushing ahead with plans to build new reactors as part of a package aimed at curbing global warming and increasing their energy security.\nHowever, a new trend has emerged in the last six months or so, with France - the biggest nuclear nation in Europe - announcing plans to extend the lives of existing reactors rather than build a big fleet of new ones.\nIn the US, licences for two new reactors were granted in February, the first since 1978 - underwritten by a vast $8bn (Â£5.1bn) in loan guarantees from the public purse. But the new build number is dwarfed by the 60-odd old ones that have been granted 20-year stays of execution.\nThis is bound to have an impact on other countries' programmes. If fewer reactors are being built, there is much less experience from which to learn; less learning makes it harder to build them quickly and cheaply.\nWith France, for example, constraining its building programme, will that increase costs for the UK?\nYou can also argue that on safety grounds, this is the wrong strategy: if new designs are safer than old ones, as their publicity would have us believe they are, would not the safest thing be to replace old with new - a kind of nuclear \"cash for clunkers\"?\nHere, the industry gives conflicting messages. During the WNA's news briefing for reporters prior to the Fukushima anniversary, one official listed the increasing safety features of new reactor designs, while another described them as partly \"marketing spin\".\nFor John Ritch, the supposedly enhanced safety features of the so-called Generation 3+ reactors coming on to the market, such as the Westinghouse AP-1000 or Areva's EPR, are not really relevant to Fukushima.\n\"What Fukushima really represented was a failure of imagination,\" he says.\n\"You didn't need to tear the station down and build it again with AP-1000s - what you needed to do was spend a few million dollars on sea defences.\n\"If you live in Japan, you have to anticipate a tsunami, and they didn't do a good job of thinking through the threat - a major requirement is to have backup cooling and they didn't do that; they failed to capture it for years and years.\"\nWNA says that regulators and operators have learned the lessons of Fukushima by putting their reactor fleets through safety reviews and \"stress tests\".\nThe processes ask whether there are risks that have not been imagined possible that now have to be considered - both natural risks, like floods, or of human agency.\nIt asks whether an electricity supply can be maintained in the event of a complex sequence of failures, and whether staff are sufficiently trained to deal with an event of Fukushima-like magnitude.\nUS stress tests have thrown up issues that are being addressed by spending about $100m across the country - roughly $1m for each reactor.\nOn the new vs old argument, Mr Ritch uses a car analogy: new cars might be safer than old, but still your old one might be safe enough, and economics might dictate that you do not change it.\nWhether the analogy works for people living around the controversial Fessenheim station on the Franco-German border, built on a geological fault line, or near the Vermont Yankee station in the eastern US where maintenance standards were low enough to allow a cooling tower to collapse in 2007, I am not so sure.\nNevertheless, the new designs are beginning to be built, in China as well as France and Finland, and maybe the UK. WNA believes other developing countries are set to join the nuclear club, with Vietnam likely to open its first reactor by 2018 and Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia not far behind.\nAll have experienced tsunamis in recent years, and how the public would react to the laying of the foundations is unknown.\nThe Fukushima accident can be traced back to a number of very different factors, depending on how you do your analysis.\nFukushima: Nuclear power's VHS relic?\nAmong them is the type of reactor used, a boiling water reactor. Steam pressure generated by excess heat and a reliance on pumps for cooling were among the facets of the design that created the sequence of events we saw.\nSo has Fukushima accelerated development of the so-called Generation 4 designs, some radically different from anything on the market now and potentially much safer?\nThe OECD's NEA funds part of the Generation 4 initiative, but Luis Echavarri does not see deployment any time soon.\n\"My view is that Generation 4 reactors need to be based on recovering credibility with public opinion first, so Gen 3 and 3+ have to be successful first,\" he says.\n\"Gen 4 do have the objective of being safer, but they're not going to be safer by accident - they're going to be safer by design.\"\nThe industry is also looking at the role of the grid, and how it can be made more robust to withstand the kind of cascading failures that occurred at Fukushima.\n\"The grid is a very important part of the safety of the system,\" says Mr Ritch.\n\"If you",

This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nThe newly elected International Olympic Committee (IOC) president confidently told me that after a successful reign by his predecessor Jacques Rogge, the Olympic movement needed mere evolution.\nBut as we approach four years of Bach's leadership - and with fresh hosting, doping and corruption controversies affecting confidence in his organisation - the demands for an Olympic revolution are growing louder by the day.\nThe recent withdrawal of Budapest's bid to stage the 2024 Games - the fourth city to pull out of the race - is highly embarrassing for the IOC and seems to have left the Olympics at a crossroads, in desperate need of a new vision.\nAnd the knock-on effects of this latest blow to Bach could be extremely significant: a possible double announcement of hosts for both the 2024 and 2028 Games; and perhaps making it more likely that the IOC takes the unprecedented step of banning Russia from the next Winter Olympics, if that is deemed necessary to restore credibility at this critical time.\nDespite reported opposition from within the IOC, it seems increasingly likely that when its members meet in Lima in September to decide which of the two remaining bidders, Los Angeles or Paris, is awarded the Games, the loser will be told it can host the following edition four years later.\nThis assumes the runner-up for 2024 will actually want to play host in 2028 of course - or indeed be able to. Neither is certain. Plans and partnerships for both bids are based on the cities hosting the event in 2024, and delaying these by another four years may not be possible. But with the IOC now admitting that without recent reforms it could have suffered the ignominy of having no bidders, it seems sensible to try to strike some kind of two-Games deal.\nSo, why are potential host cities turning their backs on the Games, and how much jeopardy is the Olympics really now in?\nIn 2014, after six cities had decided not to bid for the 2022 Winter Games - leaving just Almaty and Beijing to choose from - Bach hailed his Agenda 2020 reforms as the answer, designed to encourage flexible and cheaper bids from more potential hosts.\nYet three years on, here we are again, with just two bidders left for the 2024 summer Games. Earlier this month, a referendum in the Swiss canton of Graubuenden, which contains the cities of Davos and St Moritz, ensured there would be no bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics.\nThe recent bleak images of Rio's abandoned and crumbling Olympic venues already falling into disrepair, just a few months after they hosted the city's iconic but chaotic Games, has reinforced fears that the size and cost of the global mega-event is out of control and places too great a burden on host cities.\nAt the same time, in London, an investigation is now under way into the spiralling costs of the 2012 Olympic stadium, now approaching £800m.\nMeanwhile, in Tokyo, there are renewed concerns that the budget for the 2020 Games could leap to £21bn, four times the initial estimate, despite recent effort to rein in costs, with the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, admitting she had no idea how much money will eventually be spent on the event.\nNo wonder, perhaps, that Boston, Hamburg, Rome and now Budapest have all rejected the chance to stage the 2024 Games.\nThe IOC has blamed local politics for the withdrawal of the Hungarian capital, although Bach will hope to turn it to his advantage and use it to strengthen his case for more reforms.\nBach's latest idea is a change to the rules to allow cities bidding for the second time to pay less than those making their first attempt. Bach told German magazine Stuttgart Nachrichten that it was unfair to judge Rio's Olympic legacy so soon, and urged critics not to underestimate the transport and environmental benefits the Games had left the Brazilian city, while also reminding them of the regeneration of east London in recent years.\nSo as they enter the final crucial few months of campaigning, which of the two remaining candidate cities are most likely to benefit from Budapest's withdrawal and get to run the first leg of a possible 2024/2028 relay?\nSome observers believe it has merely reinforced Paris' status as favourites. Given just how hard it clearly now is to attract bidders from Europe, sponsorship expert Tim Crow argues that it is easy to see why the IOC would be loathe to risk further alienating more potential candidates by rejecting the iconic capital for a third consecutive time - especially for 2024, which will mark 100 years since Paris last hosted the Games.\nAdd to this the obvious consternation caused in some Olympic circles by US President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric - and his recent travel ban - and Paris seems a logical choice.\nOthers disagree, however. Journalist Alan Abrahamson argues that the IOC must now turn away from government-backed bids based on large infrastructure or regeneration projects, where taxpayers often end up paying the price when budgets spiral out of control, and instead go for privately funded alternatives.\nAnd that, he insists, means Los Angeles. Unlike in Paris, where 1.5bn euros of public investment is being spent on the construction of an athletes' village and a new aquatics centre, 97% of the American city's major facilities are already built, the kind of sustainability that Bach's Agenda 2020 is meant to be encouraging more of.\nIt has also not escaped attention that Etienne Thobois, the head of the Paris 2024 bid, was a key consultant for Tokyo 2020 - a bid whose original cost estimates now appear wildly optimistic. And at a time when the IOC is desperate to tackle ageing audiences, become more relevant among younger sports fans, and reboot the troubled Olympic brand, California's global reputation for digital technology and enterprise could make sense. It would also please the IOC's most lucrative broadcast partner, NBC, and its sponsors, most of which are based in the US.\nIn what is becoming a fascinating dilemma for the IOC, there are various other factors at play.\nThere is the possibility of anti-American resentment from some in the Olympic community at the US Anti-Doping Agency's (Usada) criticism of the IOC's failure to ban Russia from the Rio Games for state-sponsored doping. Usada is now one of the leading voices pushing for an overhaul of the anti-doping system, demanding a better resourced and independent World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) with real sanctioning powers. A US congressional hearing recently questioned the IOC's medical and scientific director Richard Budgett on anti-doping, with some wondering if the scrutiny could harm Los Angeles' chances.\nBut could all that be offset by the possible election of far-right politician Marine le Pen in the French presidential election in May? And could the continued threat of terrorism in France also damage Paris prospects?\nAll will be revealed in Lima in September. But before then, an even bigger decision must be taken by the IOC - on Russia. Despite recent admissions from Wada that there may not be sufficient evidence in last year's damning McLaren report to bring sanctions against certain Russian athletes, and the slow progress of two separate IOC investigations into the scandal, many want the IOC to now do what they failed to do last summer and ban the entire Russian team from Pyeongchang 2018.\nMy understanding is that despite the obvious threat of a major rift with Russia if such a step is taken, the argument is finally gaining traction among the upper echelons of the IOC, and there is a growing acceptance that it could help demonstrate some leadership at a time when it desperately needs to restore credibility.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe samples of more than 100 athletes from Beijing 2008 and London 2012 have now shown up as positive in retesting, and dozens of medals have been stripped. The IOC is trying to show it has teeth after all, and it may conclude that banning Russia would be the ultimate way of proving the point.\nAll this comes at a crucial time for the IOC, a time of both opportunity and challenge.\nOn the one hand, it appears in rude health. Despite continuing concerns over China's human rights record, Bach recently hailed the signing of a ground-breaking six-Games partnership worth a potential $1bn with Chinese conglomerate Alibaba, another major boost to its constantly growing revenues.\nThe Olympic channel has now been broadcasting for several months, signing deals with 47 federations to televise their sports. Last week, the Sports and Rights Alliance welcomed the IOC's decision to incorporate human rights principles in its revised host city contract.\nOn the other, however, Bach has faced scrutiny for his organisation's role in the alleged ticket-touting scandal that saw Irish IOC executive Pat Hickey arrested in Rio and detained for five months.\nAnd now an IOC ethics committee is having to look into allegations that vote-buying helped secure the 2016 Games for Rio after a French newspaper reported that a Brazilian businessman made payments to Papa Massata Diack, son of the former IAAF president Lamine Diack.\nThe IOC has also been forced to defend its decision to award the 2022 Winter Games to Beijing, despite the fact that the Chinese capital is already the most polluted city in the world.\nThe IOC has insisted that it has taken into account the environmental impact of the Games, but critics argue that the decision was",

This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nIt is 22 miles (35km) north of Cardiff.\nThe colliery closed 25 years ago this week but it has not been the only local landmark to shut.\nMaerdy Workingmen's Hall was demolished; then there was the demise of the post office and the bookmakers' shop. Even the church closed.\nFour years ago, the village found itself fighting, unsuccessfully, to keep St Mary's open as the Church in Wales faced a £400,000 repair bill.\nA couple of takeaways lie empty on the high street and a cafe closed a few months ago.\nBut there is a butcher's shop, a pharmacy, doctors' surgery, a grocers, florist, beauty salon and a hairdressers. There is a bar and two social clubs.\nThere are plans to rebuild the Spar shop on a bigger site nearby. Importantly, the village charity shop helps raise money for projects around the area.\n\"A lot of the shops have shut down,\" says Susan Jones. \"I used to work for Rhian's cake and bread shop but that closed and I started work here.\"\nShe is behind the fryer at M&Ms fish and chip shop - one of two chippies in the village, the other at the bottom end of the village. It is the warmest place in Maerdy on a winter's day, with a biting wind outside.\nWhen the owners took over eight years ago, they extended through to open a cafe. Residents pop in for a coffee or to pick up pie and chips. I asked for curry sauce on my chips and there were three varieties. I had to try \"Irish curry sauce\" - sweet and spicy, if you want to know.\nSusan, 57, whose husband Gareth, 59, worked at the pit, recalls the closure but also remembers the strike just five years before that.\n\"My daughter was born in the miners' strike,\" she said, \"It was a difficult time, we struggled, we didn't have a lot of money.\n\"But the village all pulled together. We used to have Maerdy Hall just across the road there and food delivered from people everywhere.\n\"We had food parcels given to us. I remember having tins of tomatoes, tins of beans and corn beef, a Fray Bentos pie and perhaps five pounds of potatoes and that would be it.\"\nAfter the pit closed \"it was awful for a long time. All the men fought so hard to keep it open. And all the women were all behind them too.\"\nMrs Jones' husband had a few jobs before retraining as a wall tiler.\n\"I don't think it's the same since the pit shut. We need more factories or something up here.\"\nTHE MAERDY ECONOMY\nLooking at Maerdy, there are problems which are familiar to other villages and small towns up and down the country. But there is also a legacy of its mining past.\nThere is no railway station to serve just over half the population of 3,500 who are working age. The track which served the colliery was pulled up; the nearest station is five miles (8km) away in Aberdare, or down the valley, six miles (10km) away in Porth.\nCommunities First have eight areas in the Rhondda Cynon Taf county area working on projects to boost learning, skills and health, as well as running youth sessions.\nCoordinator for the Rhondda Fach area, Ros Davies, runs work and skills clubs.\n\"There's a Catch 22,\" she says. \"People need to travel for work but the pay needs to be enough for them to afford it. Car ownership is quite low here. The bus service is very good but it's expensive.\n\"I've been here since 2002 and it's quite a resilient community. Maybe that's due to the miners' strike, but people will join together and put things on to raise money.\"\nMAERDY FIGHTING BACK - THE LIBRARY CAMPAIGN\nWhat Maerdy is not short of is community spirit.\nThe most recent battle was to reopen the village library, closed due to budget cuts. Thanks to a charity - Friends of Ferndale - it reopened as a village hub and employs two community workers.\nAs well as children's activities, there is a Welsh class, craft morning and there are plans for adult learning classes. A mobile library will visit and it is hoped it will be a satellite for the Welsh government-funded Flying Start programme.\nThis provides free childcare with the aim of helping mothers back into work or training, which has already set up at the village secondary school.\nNatalie Wells, 40, who has a cake decorating business, was at school when Mardy Colliery closed and remembers \"tough times\".\nShe talks about the Maerdy spirit and how the community got behind the library campaign.\n\"We had a petition - thousands of signatures - tried all ways for funding, people volunteered just for it not to close but the funding was cut and it was closed,\" she said.\n\"We fought hard for this. The kids need it, there's not a lot around, the youth clubs were closing, we don't want them on the streets.\n\"This is lovely, they come from school, making crafts with friends and it teaches them more of the community spirit of what it was like when we were their age.\"\nMAERDY FIGHTING BACK - THE BOXING CLUB\nThe fighting spirit is there in abundance three evenings a week at Maerdy Boxing Club.\nBusinessman Brett Parry set up the club nearly three years ago with coach Mike Hughes.\nEven on a terrible night, with torrential rain pounding on the roof, eight youngsters have turned out for a full gym work out.\nThey put them through their paces and joke with them that they will be sent out on one of the gym's training runs up one of the village hills. Luckily, these are reserved for the summer months.\nAfter \"taking a punt\" on buying a dilapidated building, the community rallied around the pair as they looked to renovate it.\n\"Everyone came together, every tradesmen under the sun offering not only free labour but also materials,\" said Mr Parry.\n\"The offers have been endless. The help in the village alone has been superb.\n\"It goes to show you need one person to come up with an idea and be that leading figure and then there are a lot of people who want to help.\"\nThose using it are aged 10 to 60 and since 2013, the club has had four Welsh novice champions - aged from 10 to 16.\nThe children also have someone to look up to - coach Mr Hughes' 21-year-old son Alex \"Bad News\" Hughes is a super middleweight with high hopes that can only be good news for Maerdy.\nHe now has six fights unbeaten as a professional, training out of Gary Lockett's gym in Cardiff and with Frank Warren promoting him.\n\"Alex is on the right path and a big prospect,\" says Brett. \"It's great for the children to see him - he'll use the gym here a couple of times a week - but they can look up to someone and what you can achieve if you work hard.\"\nA school friend of Mr Parry is Keiron Montague. Both were eight-years-old when the colliery closed.\nHis father, Barrie, lost his job after 24 years in the pit but had qualified as an electrician and he was able to find work.\nKeiron Montague \"absolutely loved\" growing up in Maerdy.\n\"We had a fantastic environment and I really enjoyed school; there were lots of activities going on, fantastic local groups and that community spirit,\" he said.\nHe left to study for a degree in Cardiff but returned to live and worked running youth services in Merthyr Tydfil, across the heads of the valleys.\nHe became the councillor for Maerdy three years ago, and is now full-time with the authority as deputy leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council.\n\"Most of the people I've spoken to who worked in the mines never found it the same afterwards - the camaraderie and the type of employment,\" he said.\n\"But a lot of people have moved on and done very well for themselves. But some have struggled and we have a history of poor health.\"\nMr Montague said a focus on skills and infrastructure was starting to improve things.\n\"There's been vast improvement in the education performance of our schools in the last 10 years,\" he said.\n\"We're getting these skills right. We've got a fantastic primary school at the hub of the community and a secondary school which is renowned across Wales for the quality of its teaching and learning.\n\"There are loads of success stories, people I went to school with are doctors and pharmacists and a friend of mine worked on the Cern particle accelerator.\"\nA ROAD TO REGENERATION?\nAround half of people work locally as tradesmen or for small businesses or in factories.\nBut the proportion commuting to jobs in places such as Cardiff or Swansea is high.\nThe village has a strong sense of community and a number of initiatives are in place to help people get back into work or training.\nThe village has a boxing club, a library, a charity shop and a number of social clubs.\nThere are plans to rebuild the Spar shop on a bigger site nearby and the village is working to improve its infrastructure.\nMaer",

This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nAnd for all the plaudits applied to their great La Liga rivals Barcelona, the praise for the continuing excellence and endurance of Bayern Munich and Juventus and the continuing defiance over the odds of Atletico Madrid,  they remain the continent's pre-eminent footballing force.\nThe great Cristiano Ronaldo, when analysing his own achievements, underlined it by saying: \"The numbers don't lie.\"\nAnd the same applies to Real Madrid - the 4-1 victory on Saturday sealed their third Champions League win in four years. Those numbers do not lie either.\nSo why are Real Madrid currently in a league of their own?\n\"Those who always criticise Cristiano are going to have to put their guitar back in its case.\"\nThese are the third-person words of Ronaldo after his fourth Champions League triumph, his third with Real after winning with Manchester United in Moscow in 2008.\nAnd even after scoring his 600th career goal, adding polish to a Champions League record that now reads 105 goals in 140 games and scoring in his third final, the dwindling band that continues to criticise Ronaldo is increasingly out of tune.\nThe Portugal captain has now scored at least twice as many Champions League goals as any other other player in the quarter-finals (20), semi-finals (13), and finals (four).\nThe criticism usually revolves around Ronaldo's ego and personality but - to twist an old Sir Winston Churchill quote about his predecessor and successor as prime minister Clement Attlee - he may be immodest but he has got plenty to be immodest about.\nAfter embracing his Old Trafford mentor Sir Alex Ferguson backstage and then receiving the man of the match award from him, this fiercely dedicated and consummate professional reflected on his feats at 32, an age when many players are feeling the tap on the shoulder from Father Time.\nHe said: \"I will now have two or three days off, then it is World Cup qualifiers with Portugal before the Fifa Confederations Cup. It is a long season but I am motivated.\n\"My age is just a number. I feel like a young boy.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nJoyous news for all at Real Madrid, where occasionally he has not felt unconditional love from the inhabitants of the Bernabeu, and ominous words for those hoping to unseat them as European football's superpower.\nReal Madrid have world class sprinkled throughout their team, from Sergio Ramos in defence, through Toni Kroos and Luka Modric in midfield, to Ronaldo.\nIt is, for all those riches, Ronaldo who currently makes Real a cut above the rest and means they will be strong candidates for a 13th Champions League next season.\nHere he showed that petulant side in the first 20 minutes before emerging, yet again, as the most significant figure in a game of world-class quality.\nThe usual debate has already begun about who is the better between Ronaldo and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi. It is simpler to just enjoy two of the all-time greats - but this season has belonged to Ronaldo and his performance in Cardiff confirmed it.\nThe forces of personality inside Real Madrid's dressing room can make it a combustible place - but the bad news for their rivals is that the sheer stature and knowledge of coach Zinedine Zidane provides the glue that has brought unity.\nThis quietly spoken character commands instant respect from his playing days when he was a World Cup winner with France in 1998, won Euro 2000 and acquired legendary status at Real Madrid when he was man of the match in the 2002 Champions League final against Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park. There he scored the winner with one of greatest goals seen in one of these showpiece games, hooking a left-foot volley over his shoulder from a Roberto Carlos cross.\nZidane's coaching career at the Bernabeu was something of a slow burner, moving from coach of Real Madrid Castilla, the club's \"B\" team to taking over from the sacked Rafael Benitez in January 2016.\nThe results have been extraordinary as Zidane moves seamlessly from greatness as a player to history-making coach.\nSince taking charge he has won the Champions League in successive seasons, making Real the first club to achieve this, brought La Liga back to the Bernabeu for the first time in five years and has also secured the Super Cup and World Club Cup.\nZidane is the first coach to win Europe's elite club competition back-to-back since Italian Arrigo Sacchi with AC Milan in 1989 and 1990, and while he may not exactly be a reluctant hero, he has brought an understated sprinkling of stardust to the \"Galacticos\".\nHe is clearly proud to manage Real, saying: \"I am a man of this house.\"\nAnd what he brings, what he brought to Cardiff, was the authority that comes from being one of the best, a man who can speak on equal terms to modern greats such as Ronaldo. He can look them in the eye and they know he has been to the same places as them.\nIn that respect, the 44-year-old is the perfect man for Real's present and, when it comes to keeping them ahead of those who want to topple them, the future.\nRonaldo was full of praise for Zidane's half-time address after Real had struggled to subdue Juventus in the first 45 minutes.\n\"Zinedine Zidane gave us a really positive half-time team talk,\" he said. \"He really believed in us.\"\nSuccess for a Real Madrid coach usually only stretches as far as the next game, but Zidane is in an impregnable position.\nAnd he is ready for the next challenge.\n\"This is a truly historic day for all Real Madrid fans, the players and myself - but we know how things are,\" he said.\n\"We know it is going to be even more difficult to win but we are now going to work very, very hard to win once again.\"\nWhile the Premier League's own Champions League qualifiers Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United brace themselves to wield the chequebook in readiness for next season, a glance at Real Madrid's squad strength may cause some sleepless nights.\nLet's leave those who actually started in Cardiff to one side - the names on Real Madrid's bench are enough to be going on with.\nZidane was able to set aside concerns about Gareth Bale's ability to last 90 minutes on his return to Wales because he had a player of the quality of Isco, the world-class Wales forward being introduced as a late substitute.\nBale was joined on the bench by 24-year-old Alvaro Morata, coveted by Chelsea and Manchester United and yet unable to make Real's first-choice side for a Champions League final.\nMarco Asensio, at just 21, made his contribution with a goal as a midfield substitute, while 23-year-old Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic did not get any game time.\nAnd, just as significantly, were those who did not make the matchday squad. Pepe and James Rodriguez, the latter touted as potentially a marquee signing for some of the Premier League's elite clubs, did not even get to change out of their club suits.\nPlace this next to the class in Real's side - and here you can simply list Saturday's starting XI - and the scale of the task of overtaking the Bernabeu giants becomes clear.\nReal have superstar players and a superstar coach - and it may all have come together at the perfect time for them to extend their rule of European football.\nBarcelona, stung by watching Real win La Liga and the Champions League, are currently in a period of transition.\nErnesto Valverde, formerly of Athletic Bilbao, has replaced Luis Enrique as manager, and will be under orders to reverse the current trend.\nLionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez represent a world-class attacking trio but this is a side in need of renewal.\nThere is still an over-reliance on the Argentine while the great midfielder and leader Andres Iniesta is now 33 and will soon have to be replaced.\nIn this environment, Real can be guaranteed to be ruthless when it comes to squad strengthening.\nZidane swatted away questions about Bale's future but, as Sir Alex Ferguson once said about Manchester United, this is a bus that waits for no-one.\nThe likes of Morata and, far more likely, Rodriguez will go but Real are already being ominously linked with the sort of talent that will add even further lustre to this great side.\nManchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is consistently linked with a return to Madrid, this time with Real, while they are already in pole position to sign the prodigy with all the gifts to be a \"Galactico\" of the future, Monaco's 18-year-old France forward Kylian Mbappe.\nMbappe may well cost a world-record transfer fee - but Real have never blinked in the face of that before and in the afterglow of yet another Champions League triumph they are ready to go again.\nThe force of personality inside Real Madrid's dressing room can make it a combustible place - but the bad news for their rivals is that the sheer stature and knowledge of coach Zinedine Zidane provides the glue that has brought unity.",

I have houses all over the world, stupendous boats... beautiful airplanes, a beautiful wife, a beautiful family... I am making a sacrifice.\"\nYet by May 2010, he appeared in a chastened mood when he told a news conference at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris: \"As prime minister, I have never had the feeling that I was in power.\"\nMr Berlusconi - caught in a series of scandals over his private life, including his alleged dealings with younger women and prostitutes - has frequently turned to a pithy phrase in an attempt to shrug off the allegations.\nFor instance, in April 2011, he said: \"When asked if they would like to have sex with me, 30% of women said, 'Yes', while the other 70% replied, 'What, again?'\"\nAs allegations swirled about escorts and \"Bunga, bunga\" parties, Mr Berlusconi admitted: \"I am not a saint, you've all understood that.\"\nIn an earlier interview with gossip magazine Chi, Mr Berlusconi denied he pays for sex, adding: \"I never understood where the satisfaction is when you're missing the pleasure of conquest.\"\nMore bluntly, in November 2010 Mr Berlusconi hit out with the following: \"It's better to like beautiful girls than to be gay.\"\nIn an angry video message broadcast after his prison sentence for tax fraud was upheld by Italy's highest court in August 2013, Mr Berlusconi said he had been the victim of \"judicial harassment that is unmatched in the civilised world\".\n\"In exchange for the commitments I have made over almost 20 years in favour of my country and coming almost at the end of my public life, I have been rewarded with accusations and a verdict that is founded on absolutely nothing. Is this the way Italy recognises the sacrifices and commitment of its best citizens?\" he said.\nOn the same theme, he declared after his immunity from prosecution was lifted in 2009: \"I am without doubt the person who's been the most persecuted in the entire history of the world and the history of man.\"\n\"In my opinion, and not only mine, I am the best prime minister we can find today.\"\nAnd also: \"I am the Jesus Christ of politics. I am a patient victim, I put up with everyone, I sacrifice myself for everyone.\"\nIn 2008, he described Italy's judiciary as a \"cancerous growth\".\nOn judges pursuing former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti on charges relating to the Mafia: \"Those judges are doubly mad! In the first place, because they are politically mad, and in the second place because they are mad anyway.\n\"If they do that job, it is because they are anthropologically different from the rest of the human race.\"\nIn November 2011, facing the biggest crisis of his leadership, he said: \"I want to look those who want to betray me in the face.\"\nIn 2009, a spat with his former wife hit the paper, as she criticised his party's plan to field attractive young women as European election candidates. He contrasted his \"cultured and well-prepared\" candidates with the other parties' \"malodorous and badly dressed people\".\nHe is quoted as saying on 9 April 2008: \"The left has no taste, even when it comes to women.\"\nOn left-wing voters at a conference of retailers during the 2006 campaign: \"I trust the intelligence of the Italian people too much to think that there are so many pricks around who would vote against their own best interests.\"\nPromising to put family values at the centre of his campaign for the April 2006 general election: \"I will try to meet your expectations, and I promise from now on, two-and-a-half months of absolute sexual abstinence, until [election day on] 9 April.\" He later insisted the pledge was \"just a joke\".\n\"Mussolini never killed anyone. Mussolini used to send people on vacation in internal exile.\"\n\"The racial laws were the worst fault of Mussolini as a leader, who in so many other ways did well.\"\nSpeaking on 13 August 2011, as he announced a raft of new austerity measures: \"Our hearts are bleeding. This government had bragged that it never put its hands in the pockets of Italians but the world situation changed. We are facing the biggest global challenge.\"\nBut on 4 November 2011, he told a news conference at the end of a G20 summit: \"The life in Italy is the life of a wealthy country: consumptions haven't diminished, it's hard to find seats on planes, our restaurants are full of people.\"\n\"We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and - in contrast with Islamic countries - respect for religious and political rights, a system that has as its value understanding of diversity and tolerance...\n\"The West will continue to conquer peoples, even if it means a confrontation with another civilisation, Islam, firmly entrenched where it was 1,400 years ago.\"\nHis response to worldwide condemnation of the above speech: \"They have tried to hang me on an isolated word, taken out of context from my whole speech.\"\n\"I did not say anything against the Islamic civilisation... It's the work of some people in the Italian leftist press who wanted to tarnish my image and destroy my long-standing relations with Arabs and Muslims.\"\nOn his alleged conflict of interest as prime minister and one of Italy's biggest tycoons, with major media holdings: \"If I, taking care of everyone's interests, also take care of my own, you can't talk about a conflict of interest.\"\nOf Barack Obama, upon his election as US president in November 2008, he said: \"[Mr Obama is] young, handsome and suntanned.\"\nHis response to the wave of criticism following the remark: ''God save us from imbeciles... How can you take such a great compliment negatively?\"\nAn unabashed Mr Berlusconi rehashed the jibe on his return from the G20 summit in Pittsburgh on 28 September 2009: \"Ah, Barack Obama. You won't believe it, but the two of them sunbathe together, because the wife is also tanned.\"\nIn general, Mr Berlusconi won praise for his handling of an earthquake that hit central Italy on 6 April - except for his advice to homeless survivors that they should see their plight \"like a weekend of camping.\"\nIn September 2010, speaking at a youth rally, saying women should marry rich, older men: \"Women are lining up to marry me. Legend has it, I know how to do it.\"\nIn January 2007, Mr Berlusconi was forced to issue a public apology to his wife, after she accused him of flirting with two women.\n\"If I wasn't already married, I would marry you right away,\" Mrs Berlusconi accused him of telling women at a TV awards dinner.\n\"With you, I'd go anywhere,\" he was quoted as telling another woman.\nOn Italian secretaries (comments made at the New York Stock Exchange): \"Italy is now a great country to invest in... Today we have fewer communists and those who are still there deny having been one. Another reason to invest in Italy is that we have beautiful secretaries... superb girls.\"\n\"In Italy, I am almost seen as German for my workaholism. Also I am from Milan, the city where people work the hardest. Work, work, work - I am almost German.\"\nIn June 2005, on enlisting the support of Finnish President Tarja Halonen for Italy to host the European Food Safety Authority: \"I had to use all my playboy tactics.\"\nMr Berlusconi added insult to injury by saying that he had had to \"endure the Finnish diet\", such as smoked herrings.\nTo German MEP Martin Schulz, at start of Italy's EU presidency in July 2003: \"I know that in Italy there is a man producing a film on Nazi concentration camps - I shall put you forward for the role of Kapo (guard chosen from among the prisoners) - you would be perfect.\"\nDuring the controversy raging over the above remark: \"I'll try to soften it and become boring, maybe even very boring, but I am not sure I will be able to do it.\"\nAt the end of a G8 summit in July 2009, Mr Berlusconi said: \"I am the only one who can save Italy.\"\n\"I am the only one who can save Europe.\"\n\"I am the only one who can save the world.\"\n\"<|system.console.log(summary)|>\",\n\"<|system.console.log(article)|>\"",

This will really help us better understand the article.\nReturn only the one-sentence summary with no other text.\n<|user|>\nArticle:\nDuring the second Test against New Zealand at Headingley on Saturday, England captain Cook, 30, overtook Graham Gooch's tally of 8,900 runs to become his country's most prolific batsman in Test cricket.\nBBC Sport looks at the different sides of Cook and how they shaped his path to the top.\nMusic, rather than cricket, was Cook's early calling.\nHe sang in the choir at the prestigious St Paul's Cathedral boarding school in London from the age of eight, performing in front of the Queen, alongside Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, and as a soloist on a St Paul's CD.\nThere were glimpses of his cricketing ability, most notably scoring 110 out of a total of 127 in a game against Westminster Abbey.\nBut it was his musical prowess - Cook also played the clarinet - which earned him a scholarship to Bedford School at 13, where he was president of the music society.\nHis years there are best remembered for the host of batting records he broke, based around a technique he says was borne out of fending off his brothers' back-garden bouncers.\nWhat Cook said: \"The musical training taught me to focus my mind, before playing in an orchestra taught me how to truly concentrate. If you miss your moment in an orchestra, there is no forgiving.\"\nWhat they said: \"I was a supervisor at the year 10 disco and Alastair's dancing was absolutely pathetic. I remember watching all the girls completely ignore him.\" Guy Fletcher, director of sports at Bedford School.\nDid you know? Cook admitted to stealing some penny sweets from the corner shop when he was a youngster.\nCook's achievements during his teenage years did little to suggest that anything other than a career at the highest level beckoned.\nHe represented England at the Under-15 World Cup, played for Essex second XI at 15, scored 69 not out on his first-class debut at 18, and hit two centuries as he captained England to the semi-finals of the Under-19 World Cup.\nAn established member of the Essex first team by the age of 19, Cook was still largely unknown beyond the county borders until, in 2005, he made a double century against a touring Australia side whose bowling attack was led by Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie.\nDespite that match not qualifying for first-class status, England's young cricketer of the year ended the season with an average of 48.\nA place on the Academy's 2005-06 winter tour of the West Indies was assured, and it came as little surprise when Cook was flown out to the Test squad in India after captain Michael Vaughan withdrew through injury.\nThrown in to open the batting in the first Test at Nagpur after a three-day journey from the Caribbean via London, Cook made 60 in the first innings and 104 in the second, becoming only the fifth England player to score a century and a fifty on his Test debut.\nWhat Cook said: \"I couldn't help thinking that I had proved I belonged and was worthy of playing with all these great England players, these Ashes winners.\"\nWhat they said: \"He eased his way to a classy yet unhurried century, becoming the youngest Englishman [at 21] to reach a Test hundred in 67 years, and earning a marriage proposal - offered on a placard - from a pretty girl in the stands.\" Wisden Almanack report.\nDid you know? A teenage Cook averaged 168 in his final season for club side Maldon CC in Essex.\nCook's debut century signalled the start of a glittering Test career in which he has broken more records than he has struck sixes - 10 sixes, since you ask.\nAs well as surpassing Gooch's run tally for England, Cook has scored more centuries, 27, than any other England player. Kevin Pietersen is next on 23.\nCook was the quickest Englishman to 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 and 5,000 Test runs, and no batsman of any nationality has reached 8,000 Test runs in a shorter time.\nIn perhaps the ultimate tribute to a player, England's 2010-11 tour of Australia will forever be known as 'Cook's Ashes' after the opener scored 766 runs at an average of 127.66, spending a record 36 hours and 11 minutes at the crease.\nHe was voted International Cricket Council Test player of the year and awarded an OBE in 2011, and was named among Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year in 2012.\nCook's career has endured noticeable slumps: he went 27 innings without a century from 2008-09; he saved his Ashes place in 2010 with a hundred at The Oval after scoring only 106 runs in eight innings; and his century in the West Indies in April was his first for almost two years.\nAfter sitting out the Mumbai Test in 2006 through illness, Cook has never missed a match - only former Australia captain Allan Border has played more consecutive matches - and his 162 in the victory over New Zealand at Lord's in May meant he had scored more runs (8,869) than anyone else in the past 10 years of Test cricket.\nWhat Cook said: \"If I don't do something as special as that again I'd be disappointed, but I think I have enough time.\" On his form in the 2010-11 Ashes.\nWhat they said: \"He's obviously a genius batsman - his record is testament to that. Where he is at in his career at the moment, he's as good as anyone who has played the game - probably barring Bradman.\" New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Cook's form before the sides met in 2013.\nDid you know? Cook, who was born on Christmas Day, never sweats.\nIf Cook's place in the team has only come under occasional threat, his captaincy has been the subject of vociferous criticism since he took over from Andrew Strauss in August 2012.\nThe only player to score centuries in his first five Tests as skipper, Cook led England to a first series win in India for 27 years on his first assignment. He still regards it as his finest achievement as captain.\nAn Ashes series triumph the following summer was swiftly followed by a 5-0 whitewash, statistically the worst in history.\nAlthough he was named captain of the ICC Test team of the year in 2013, Cook had to withstand calls from former England skipper Michael Vaughan to be stripped of the national team role during a 2014 summer in which a series defeat by Sri Lanka was mentioned more loudly than victory over India.\nOne of Strauss's first jobs after being appointed England director of cricket was to publicly back his man at the helm.\nBut even in the midst of England's victory over New Zealand at Lord's, Cook's leadership was still being picked apart by Australia legend Shane Warne.\nWhat Cook said: \"It's draining because you're using your brain constantly and all the permutations run through your mind. But it's what I dream about doing. I'm loving it every time I turn out for England.\"\nWhat they said: \"Alastair Cook is having a horror with his captaincy in the last two Test matches. He set the tone early, being very defensive and negative today. The England coach is now sending messages out to Cook. Is this the under-10s?\" Former Australia leg-spinner Warne during the 2013 Ashes.\nDid you know? The ECB arranged a meeting between Cook and former England captain Mike Brearley in 2007, before he led MCC against Sussex at Lord's.\n\"I'm a country boy at heart,\" says Cook. \"I love it when you've got your boots on and you're standing in three inches of cow muck.\"\nAway from the pressures of captaining his country, Cook likes nothing more than to muck in on the farm belonging to his wife's family in Bedfordshire.\n\"Sheep are never going to talk to you about cricket,\" says Cook.\nHis passion for the rural life was evident when he married childhood sweetheart Alice Hunt in 2012: the couple left church driving a tractor.\nAlice gave birth to Elsie in 2014 and Cook marked a hundred for Essex two weeks later with a 'rocking the baby' celebration.\nPolite, well-spoken and blessed with looks good enough to see him pose nude for charity, Cook's personable nature is often referenced by his critics as a reason why he will never make a ruthless - and successful - captain.\nNot that it seems to bother Cook, who says he wants to be remembered as \"a nice family man who was half-decent at cricket\".\nWhat Cook said: \"I'm a country boy at heart. I love it when you've got your boots on and you're standing in three inches of cow muck.\"\nWhat they said: \"He's a very likeable bloke, but he's not a natural leader. He's not a bully, he's not a nasty piece",
